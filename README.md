# Security Navigation Stack (ROS2 Humble)

## 1. Overview
- This repository implements a ROS2-based navigation subsystem.
- It includes 2D LiDAR-based SLAM, localization, and Nav2 bringup.
- The main focus is controller-level comparison between DWB and MPPI.
- The system is designed for indoor security patrol scenarios.
