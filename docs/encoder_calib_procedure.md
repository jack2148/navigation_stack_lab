Encoder Calibration Procedure (Air test)

Goal: determine ticks_per_rev and sign convention.

Steps

Mark wheel with tape (one reference point).

Rotate EXACTLY 1 revolution (360 deg).

Record delta ticks for left/right wheel.

Repeat 3 times each direction (CW/CCW).

Decide:

ticks_per_rev = mean(|delta|)

invert_left/right if sign is reversed vs expected direction
